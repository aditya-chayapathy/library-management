Library-Management
==================
The main objective of this application is to carry out the various activities that are being performed in the library using classes and file handling concepts in C++. This application was developed for three types of users. They are the Librarian(administrator), members and non-members of the library. Some of the options available to the Librarian include adding and deleting books from the library, deleting membership, keeping track of issued books etc. The options available to the members of the library include browsing books available in the library, returning and renewing books from the library etc. A non-member can also access the options available to the members of the library, but they are restricted only to browsing the books available. Each member is assigned an unique membership ID, using which books can be borrowed. The options available to the Librarian are password protected. Thus, these options can't be accessed by the members and non-members of the library. These options are indicated by a '$' symbol in the application. Whenever a book is either issued or renewed, a printed receipt is obtained which contains all the necessary details about the member and the book that is borrowed. This receipt must be produced by the member at the time of returning the book.
